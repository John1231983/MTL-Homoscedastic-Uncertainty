# Multi Task Learning with Homoscedastic Uncertainty

This repository contains the notebook of Multi Task Learning with
uncertainty implementation in Tensorflow (Both Regression and
Classification).

Please read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07115) for more
details or check this [github](https://github.com/yaringal/multi-task-learning-example) for the implementation in `keras`.
